   Normal tracking mode sends an escape sequence
    on both button press and release.  Modifier key
    (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
    is enabled by specifying parameter 1000 to DECSET.

    Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal
    tracking, but xterm also reports button-motion events.
    Motion events are reported only if the mouse pointer has
    moved to a different character cell.  It is enabled by
    specifying parameter 1002 to DECSET.  On button press
    or release, xterm sends the same codes used by normal
    tracking mode.  On button-motion events, xterm adds 32 to
    the event code (the third charac- ter, Cb).  The other
    bits of the event code specify button and modifier keys
    as in normal mode.  For example, motion into cell x,y
    with button 1 down is reported as CSI M @ CxCy. ( @ =
    32 + 0 (button 1) + 32 (motion indicator) ). Similarly,
    motion with button 3 down is reported as CSI M B CxCy.
    ( B = 32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion indicator) ).

    Any-event mode is the same as button-event mode,
    except that all motion events are reported instead
    of just those that enter a new character cell.
    It is enabled by specifying 1003 to DECSET.
